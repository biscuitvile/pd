## Accreditation

While most of the patches in this repository are the original work of the
repository owner, there are several non-trivial sections of code particularly
audio effects that have copied from public online sources and packaged as
re-usable modules in the `abstractions` directory. While efforts have been made
to include comments linking to original sources, there are still some areas
where original authorship is not properly credited.  If you see code that
you're able to identify authorship of please make a contribution to this
repository either as an issue or pull request.
